Fuck. Today I woke up at 12. Shiiiit. Missed morining practice. SSSSSHHHHHHHHHHIIIIITTT. I still have a hangover. Lesson goes: "Think twice before you, drink a morgan or two.". BTW coach messaged that he will not tolarate any more bullshit, which just pushes me deeper into the big shithole that I'm currently in. FML.
