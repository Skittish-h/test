I got kicked out, too much alcoholism, drugs, sex and smoking. TO be honest I really don't give a shit, I have enough money to buy a house in Hawaii and live chilling on the beach while hiring plenty of hawaiian chics for massages. Ys I know I'm an asshole, but I have the cash to be one. SO if you dont like it you can go lick my ass and I will maybe give you some 50$. Just so yall know im drunk af so
