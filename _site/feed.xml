&lt;p&gt;I got kicked out, too much alcoholism, drugs, sex and smoking. TO be honest I really don’t give a shit, I have enough money to buy a house in Hawaii and live chilling on the beach while hiring plenty of hawaiian chics for massages. Ys I know I’m an asshole, but I have the cash to be one. SO if you dont like it you can go lick my ass and I will maybe give you some 50$. Just so yall know im drunk af so&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Fuck. Today I woke up at 12. Shiiiit. Missed morining practice. SSSSSHHHHHHHHHHIIIIITTT. I still have a hangover. Lesson goes: “Think twice before you, drink a morgan or two.”. BTW coach messaged that he will not tolarate any more bullshit, which just pushes me deeper into the big shithole that I’m currently in. FML.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;life is a bitch. Everyone says it but you won’t believe it until you miss the goal from 2 fucking meters and loose the match because of it. And then you have to deal with all the reporters marching acrossthe field asking you just how much you fucked up. Then after you dealt with them you have to deal with those idiotic asshole fans blocking the parking lot, and throwing a toilet paper or two at your car. And the creeping the fuck out of them by suddenly honking the horn at them to make them move out of the fucking way. Then when you come back home a friend call you out. ANd even if you are tierd as hell you go. Then you manage to get drunk and cheat on your wife twice in the same night. Then you come back home knowing that our wife would have to be an idiot not to know what you did. Then you write this dumass diary for no good reason knowing that practicing with a hangover won’t be an easy task tomorrow. Life is a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
